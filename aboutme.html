    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #555;">
        I specialize in front-end development, with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. My goal is to build immersive web experiences that not only look great but also function seamlessly across all devices.

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #555;">
        With a background in graphic design, I have a keen eye for visual aesthetics, ensuring that every project I work on is both visually appealing and intuitive for users. I also have experience in backend technologies like Node.js, allowing me to create full-stack applications.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #555;">
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, blogging about web development, and contributing to open-source projects. I believe in constant learning and love taking on new challenges.
